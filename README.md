## Building
1. Install a recent version of Visual Studio, Windows SDK and WDK.
2. Clone this repo.
3. Open the `Rockchip-Windows-Drivers\build\RockchipDrivers.sln` solution in Visual Studio.
4. Set the desired build configuraton (Release or Debug).
5. Build -> Build Solution (or <kbd>Ctrl+Shift+B</kbd>).

The resulting driver binaries will be located in the `Rockchip-Windows-Drivers\build\ARM64\Debug\Output` (or Release) directory.

## Firmware
The UEFI + ACPI implementation needed to run Windows and these drivers is available at <https://github.com/edk2-porting/edk2-rk35xx>.
