# Windows on Arm device drivers for Rockchip
This repository contains drivers for RK35xx-based platforms, with a focus on RK3588(S).

## Hardware support status
|Device|Driver|Status|Additional information|
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|USB 3 ports 0/1 Host|usbxhci (Inbox)|🟢 Working|The "full" USB3 port(s) work correctly, except USB3 only works in one orientation when used with a Type-C connector.<br> Note that RK3588s devices (e.g. Opi5, Opi5B) have only 1 "full" USB3 port -- only RK3588 devices (e.g. Opi5+) have 2 "full" USB3 ports.|
|USB 3 ports 0/1 Dual Role|usbxhci (Inbox)|🔴 Not working|Host mode only, no dual role capability. Depends on USB/DP Alt Mode switching.|
|USB 3 port 2 Host|usbxhci (Inbox)|🟡 Partially working|Won't support USB1 devices without a hub.<br> USB3 port 2 works by combining a USB3-only xHCI port with a USB2 EHCI+OHCI port. Since OHCI isn't working (issue #5), this port will not work for USB1 devices.|
|USB 2.0 & 1.1|usbehci (Inbox)|🟡 Partially working|USBOHCI driver for USB 1.1 is missing in ARM64 builds (issue #5).|
|PCIe 3.0 & 2.1|pci (Inbox)|🟡 Partially working|Devices may work if drivers are available for them. Known issues include:<br> - NVMe SSDs do not work with in-box storport.sys (issue #6, workaround available).<br> - Devices that require cache-coherent bus or MSI do not work (e.g. Qualcomm Wi-Fi cards).<br> - Devices that require a root PCIe port do not work (e.g. XHCI).|
|SATA|storahci (Inbox)|🔴 Not working|SATA SSDs do not work with in-box storport.sys (issue #6, workaround available).|

## Building
1. Install a recent version of Visual Studio, Windows SDK and WDK.
2. Clone this repo.
3. Open the `Rockchip-Windows-Drivers\build\RockchipDrivers.sln` solution in Visual Studio.
4. Set the desired build configuraton (Release or Debug).
5. Build -> Build Solution (or <kbd>Ctrl+Shift+B</kbd>).

The resulting driver binaries will be located in the `Rockchip-Windows-Drivers\build\ARM64\Debug\Output` (or Release) directory.

## Firmware
The UEFI + ACPI implementation that is needed to run Windows and these drivers are available at <https://github.com/edk2-porting/edk2-rk35xx>.
